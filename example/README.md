# TOUI Example

## Quick Start

### Requirements

You'll need `node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine in order to
build and run the application.

### Installing

Install all dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then build the application:

```
npm run build
```

And finally start the static server with:

```
npm start
```

Navigate your browser to

application. The `TOUI` server part is expected to run on port `8181`.
